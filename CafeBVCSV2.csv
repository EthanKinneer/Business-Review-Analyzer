Daniel L.,Phoenix, AZ,9-26-2011,1,"This Brasilian restaurant is one of the more popular hangout spots in Ames where people meet and congregate over food and drinks. The dive-like squared shaped interior encompasses a row of tables stacked next to the windows and a full bar with flags of many countries to render the feel of an international fare. Some people refer to their cuisine as ""ethnic"" and its one of the few places that contribute to the nightlife that many consider lacking in Ames.
Their menu consists of majority salads, burgers and sandwiches. My friends and I decided to share an order of Cheese Empanadas ($4) which included two fried empanadas with mozzarella, cheddar, muenster, and parmesan embedded. The overall texture and taste was okay for a dish that requires minimum preparation and execution. One of the empanadas had plenty of gooey cheeses but the other was a shell hollow in the middle. We complained it to the server and she responded with a shrug, vaguely apologized, and smiled. I expected a Brazilian meal so I ordered the Feijoada Simple ($11.95). Feijoada is Brasils national dish but the server hardly knew how to pronounce the word. The dish came with black beans, basmati rice, sautéed onions, tomatoes, garlic, collard greens, grilled pork tenderloin, Portuguese sausage, farofa, salsa, and a hardboiled egg strangely served without the yolk. I asked for them to hold the bacon and they were very nice to add more rice to fill my plate to the brim.
It turns out that the entire dish fell flat, bland, and without much flavor. The black beans lacked the deep smoky meaty aroma and the pork tenderloin turned out dry. All the ingredients were layered on top of each other but there wasnt anything in this dish that stood out to bring depth or string the flavors together. As the most expensive dish on the menu, portion was fabulous but the taste, price, and value were not. Im usually swept away by a smokin Feijoada and on this visit I didnt finish it.
My friend has been having trouble getting into the bar because their manager would not honor her U.S. State Department issued green card as a valid ID. When we were dining she proceeded to show the servers her green card as a method to avoid future problems but the two servers looked confused and couldnt give her a definitive answer. It became apparent that they had questions about her country of origin rather than to use it as method to verify her drinking age. This is quite ironic given the ownership and pride in providing an international fare.
One noticeable benefit is their free wifi but the drinking atmosphere does not make this place conducive for studying. Overall, the disparities between Cafe B and the places Ive previously visited were vast for me to consider a higher rating. Interested diners looking for authentic Brasilian cuisine will be disappointed."
Saul B,Ames, IA,2-26-2017,4,This was one of the first places I visited when I started school at Iowa State. It is surprisingly affordable for the environment and quality of food. For less than $15 you can get a massive burger and drink for lunch/dinner.The reason for the 4/5 stars is the wait staff. Sometimes they are super attentive and is one of the best dining experiences. Other times  despite the empty restaurant  it takes forever to get a menu or get the waiters attention.Ive mostly only had the burgers. The Spanish burger bring my favorite. So the spice additive varies  sometimes its a red chili powder which was almost inedible. Other times the spice is jalapeños and its barely noticeable. Either way  the burger is amazing. Unfortunately  you only get a handful of fries with the burger.You can buy an additional order of fries for $5 and it is a ton of fries. For some reason the half order of fries is $4 which doesnt make sense but whatever.I have only been there for brunch one time. Their orange juice is so good  always fresh since I can see the bartender/waiter making the juice after I ordered it. It has been a while since brunch but it was a sizable steak and other stuff.BTW  the place turns into a bar (no food or people under 21) after 9pm. Its definitely not an everyday place. It is also not too expensive that its reserved for special occasions. If you want to treat yourself  this is the perfect place!
Eric B.,Genoa, NV,9-13-2021,5,"The Soul of Brasil in the Heart of Iowa
Cafe Beaudelaire is located on the block of Campus Town that hasnt been included in the recent rounds of urban development. When Dad and I stopped by last Thursday for Dinner, there was some recent demolition that might be an indication that the ongoing pissing match between the City of Ames and the Developer is slowly reaching some kind of resolution. However, I still wonder if a beloved restaurant that has been here for over 30 years will survive the next tear down.
Dad and I are pretty careful with our COVID-related precautions, so I was a little surprised that he chose an indoor table for Dinner vs. an available outdoor table for 2. Restaurant staff were all masked and so were we until we sat down. My brother had warned me that the acoustics can be loud here, because of what looks like a metal ceiling. However, the Café was not full during our stay and conversation was easy and relaxed.
The menu is interesting and somewhat eclectic, with my only critique being that although I like my starch, Im not a big breaded and/or deep fried guy. So the Mozzarella Sticks, Jalapeno Cheddar Chicken Balls, Cheese Empanada, and Argentine Beef Empanada, and Chicken Strips were out. But the Salads, Yucca Fries, Burgers, Gyros, Cuban Sandwich, and Veggie dishes were very open to being ordered.
I settled on the garlic spaghetti with gyro meat and bread, which just missed being lick the plate good because I just couldnt finish the more than generous portion. Dad was a bit less adventurous with his delicioius cheeseburger selection. Cafe staff were marvelous, especially in terms of friendliness, follow-up, and overall professionalism. The restaurant atmosphere itself was a treat, and a welcome respite from the outside ISU Campus Town world. Go Hawkeyes!"
Catalina P.,West Lafayette, IN,10-10-2015,5,"Amazing food! Theres a vegetarian menu as well as a variety of delicious burgers. Id recommend trying the plates that include Brazilian meats/vegetables as they give an exquisite flavor.
Also the long islands and the bloody Marys are so good!"
Lisa D.,Chicago, IL,10-18-2021,5,The food was excellent. Unique Brazilian sandwiches. Fun decor. Clearly soccer fans!
C C.,Tulsa, OK,8-12-2012,5,Yucca fries with aioli was amazing! Spanish burger really good. Even had a nice vegan option (iron veggie
Ravyn D.,Omaha, NE,9-26-2016,5,This place is AMAZING!!! My whole family loved it. My mom and I bought the delicious sandwich and OMGN I can eat it every time.
Bryce A.,Boone, IA,10-22-2016,2,The food was good but the place is small and not very quiet so u cant enjoy your food service was ok
Lydia H.,Bentonville, AR,2-17-2021,5,I want to curl up in a pile of Yucca Fries and live there forever. Cover me in garlic aioli  hand me an Iguana Wana and leave me be  because Cafe Beaudelaie is my happy place.
Amanda L.,Tampa, FL,8-10-2021,5,Best place in Story county. Food  cocktails  good beer selection  the owner is HILARIOUS and very tentative. The food on the other hand CANNOT BE REPLICATED. Best food and worth every penny. This is a one of a kind hole in the wall that you dont want to miss out on.
Elizabeth W.,Nevada, IA,7-16-2015,2,"So, the reviews can only be glowing?
I stopped trying to enjoy this place. Owner acted like he was ""all that"", the frijolada was ""chorota"" (tough skins), the service too casual... and were not the stuffy kind!
My hair guy says the Long Island Tea is good. I might give the place one more try, hoping Mr. Cool isnt as cliquish as in the 90s.
One thing is to be cool and different, another is to freeze out a customer who is just an occasional visitor.
Ill be surprised if this is posted."
Cassidy B.,Saint Louis, MO,6-2-2021,5,This is a classic Ames spot! Great drinks  fun inside (and outside) atmosphere. Love the burgers and fries...the sauce on the side is KEY! They are lovely when it comes to service...and you will never get bored looking at all the statement pieces inside. A great place to meet friends  grab a long island with your hunny  or bring parents for their ISU visit. 10/10 recommend always!
Michael A.,Omaha, NE,12-6-2019,4,"
A night out with the coworkers started out in here and Im super glad it did! The place was fairly quiet for a Friday, but progressively picked up in customers. Aside from having empanadas catered from here in the past, I didnt know what else they offered but was super excited to try some new things!
I started the night with letting the bartender randomly make me a drink with a combination of liquors which turned out great! Tasted like a blueberry martini. The server also asked us an adequate amount for assistance in drinks. He was also patient when we had other coworkers and friends start to trickle in later. The yucca fries are the best choice of food you can get aside from the empanadas if youre looking for something that wont fill you up too much. If potatoes were running short nationwide, I wouldve taken another plate.Overall the service and experience was great, the only downside is that it is a little pricy."
Long B.,Wichita, KS,3-20-2013,4,"I asked my friend, where do all the kids go in Ames? He had this place in mind, and its literally located next to the campus. Very easy to find. Since its still winter in Ames at the time, there were mounds of snow and deep watered slush, so try to park as close as you can by the sidewalk. Otherwise find yourself holding yourself on the edge of the car and jump to a non slushy part.

Walking in, its a very dimly lit joint with lots of college students socializing amongst themselves. Seating is extremely limited, as this place is a small, yet comfortable joint. The only available seating was at the bar, which was adorned with currency from around the world stapled on any open spot on the bar. Apparently a patron knows the owner of the bar, and gave some money they have obtain from their travels is the story behind it.

The menu itself is quite interested. They are laminated rectangular menus binded to a metal chrome ring. To best describe it, go into a hardware store and its similar to paint/carpet/tile setup. Its fairly easy and has some interesting Brazilian appetizers and main course meals. One thing I found annoying was, that the menu wasnt clean and I got some random sticky residue on my hands. Hopefully they take note and wipe them down clean.

I ordered a Spanish Burger and they happened to have a Boulevard Wheat, a local KC beer I enjoy. The Bartender who took our order was very nice and knowledgeable of the menu items. The time it took to get our food was in the normal range of 15-20 minutes. Plenty of time to catch up with my friends.

Once we got our food, I was pleased how well plated the food was. The only thing I didnt really like was the Paprika that was on top of the bun. It makes it quite messy to eat when its all over your hands. Overall, the burger itself was cooked perfectly and the meat was tender, juicy and very good.

So if youre wanting a local favorite, and not the obvious chain places that surround Ames, give Cafe Beaudelaire a try."
Steve P. ,Marion, IA,1-22-2021,5,In case you wonder if its still great in the COVID environment  the answer is YES!!!! Got burgers and long islands to go and was blown away again!! So great. The long islands come in quart sized cups - I said that right - QUART size! Phenomenal! Ames and this restaurant are truly a blessing!! So glad they stuck it out. We will be back as often as possible !!!
Julee W. ,New Berlin, WI,12-4-2020,1,Super disappointed with Cafe B today. We always make a point to eat here while in Ames. It typically doesnt disappoint. Unfortunately  today its taken over an hour for our lunch to be served. While our waiter was incredibly nice  we had to request our food to go. A table that came in 30 minutes after us  got their food before us.
Derek V. ,Polk City, IA,4-23-2021,5,The service is great and the burgers are delicious. Some of their vegetarian options are also wonderful. Highly recommend!
Olivia A. ,Renton, WA,8-30-2021,5,I love this little restaurant! It has such a wonderful atmosphere.. very cozy and cheerful. The food and drinks are amazing. I recommend the gyros  burgers and brasilian fries especially. It does get pretty busy and being as its such a small cafe the service can be slow. But I believe in the importance of spending quality time with whoever Im dining with -- so its no bother to me. Muito obrigada!
Jennifer A,Ames, IA,7-20-15,5,OMG you guys! This place serves the best burger in Ames! Really!
Ani K. ,Ames, IA,3-2-2020,4,They make an amazing cappuccino. Really  they do  I think the best that I have had in Ames. They put a lot of thick foam on top and the coffee is wonderfully flavorful and not to bitter at all like many places. I almost always order one at the beginning of the meal  unless sometimes when it is warm out and I get their homemade lemonade instead  which is also awesome. I only have ever been here for lunch on a weekday. I have no idea how the evening vibe would be here but lunch is usually quite busy here. I have eaten their vegetarian gyros and black bean burgers. They put egg in their [blackbean] burger btw. One of the few times I ever will eat something with egg in it. The burger is above average for sure. The last 2 times I have had it they actually differed a bit in quality  but the most recent was better because it wasnt as dry as the first time that I tried it. It seems like they use some kind of grain or something in it as well as the black beans  the color is a bit light and that is a good thing (coming from someone who loves their blackbeans.) Their brazilian fries are pretty good also. On top of the burger they add corn and tomatoes and other vegetables  very tasty burger! when I have gotten the vegetarian gyros in the past I have also been very happy with those.
Shelby C.,Ames, IA,11-24-2019,3,Cafe B is great but their quantity/price point is a little off. $6 yucca fries and there are about 10 fries... Thats $0.60 per fry... I love the fries but price is a bit high. Spicy bloody Mary was delicious. And their long islands are good. Drink price  on point  food price is high.
Nicholas P. ,Centennial, CO,6-27-2020,3,"Had pros and cons. This is my experience. Firstly, food was great. Drinks were tasty. Unique food you dont find at most restaurants. Some negatives; we sat outside and there were a lot of insects biting us. Because of this we ordered our food to go (we also had a schedule to keep). Food took almost 40 minutes to arrive on what didnt appear to be a busy day. My cocktail was also warm, which Ive never had it that way before, but I dont think it was supposed to be that way. It was delicious Bathrooms were clean but tiny - just an issue of the age of the building I assume. This review isnt meant to turn you away from the business. I think there can be room for a great overall experience. This was just not one of them. Not a restaurant Id bring my parents too, even though the food was great! Sorry if it sounds harsh."
Josh S. ,Nevada, IA,5-13-2019,4,"I like going to Cafe Beaudelaire in Campustown when most of the students have gone home for the summer. It makes the place a little less noisy and it makes getting a table there a little easier. It always seems to be packed during the school year. Theres nothing fancy about the outside of this place but once you go inside it has a great atmosphere. They have live music on certain nights, typicall weekendss during the school year. I recommend the Brazilian Burger with Yucca fries. These are a nice Brazilian twist on American classics and are a mouthful of flavor. The Brazilian burger is messy to eat but has great flavor. Rather than just beef, this burger is made with beef and chorizo mixed with green pepper and onion, giving it a great spicy kick. Its topped with avocado, fried egg and the fries along with a zesty chimichurri sauce. VERY good. The also make a Cubano thats quite nice. Ive never had their popular ""Beirut"" dish (grilled chicken on a pita with similar ingredients as the Brazilian burger) but I may try that next time. Ive also had their empanadas, which I highly recommend. The staff has always been friendly and courteous. Theyre happy to answer questions about their food and make recommendations if asked. I enjoy Cafe Beaudelaire because they can take American classic dishes and put a Brazilian twist on them. Everything Ive had there has been really good. I recommend it for sure!"
Jonathan C.,Council Bluffs, IA,12-17-2020,4,Never thought of dipping fries in mayo with paprika. Not too bad.
Randy R.,Holland, MI,5-21-2020,5,Love the food and the cozy atmosphere. Great burgers  but different. I had the Baudelier bauru  a little weird but loved it. Good fries too. And surprisingly nice to our young kids  didnt expect that in a collegetown restaurant/bar geared towards students.
Wern O. ,Boston, MA,4-22-2019,5,Disclaimer : Ive never been to Brazil and dont know what authentic Brazilian food truly is. However  I can enjoy good food and when things taste a little different than the usual American palette I can vibe with that. This Ames staple serves up great American Brazilian burgers plus has a decent beer selection and thoughtful mixed drinks. Or if youre my friend  they just make one drink  and thats the Long Island Iced Tea. Looking forward to trying the rest of the Brazilian inspired menu.
Sammy M. ,Des Moines, IA,6-6-2019,5,An Ames favorite that is not a force to be reckoned with. Theyre food is out of this world delicious! An awesome take on Brazilian food here in Iowa! Seating is limited with a few spots outside. Full bar and service is awesome! They have plenty of vegetarian options as well! Right on the corner of Welch and Lincoln Way so super walkable from campus! Did I mention their long island iced teas? Be warned-theyre amazing and will hit you like a ton of bricks if youre not careful  ha!
Abena A. ,Huntington, NY,12-22-2019,4,Cafe B is definitely one of the good places on campus! Even though the menu is not that extensive  I like that it is very focused and allows you to make a quick decision on what you want to eat! I ordered the Spanish burger with a side of Brazilian fries with mayonnaise. The fries were perfect in flavor  not too salty  and had the perfect crisp. Ive never considered eating fries with mayo in the past  but once trying theirs  I was seriously blown away! Absolutely delish! Now on to the burger: the burger was pretty good  but the meat was very tasteless and somewhat dry! I was extremely disappointed by that. I think the peppers and egg and etc. definitely added to the burger  but it would have easily been a 10/10 if the meat actually had flavor. The restaurant is very small  so oftentimes I felt like everyone was squished in there  especially on busy nights. However  the space isnt too bad if youre lucky enough to get a table by the window. If they work on seasoning their meat  I would definitely give them 5 stars and a few more visits if I am ever in town.
Amanda B ,Ames, Iowa ,10-19-2016,5,Found this place on my first trip out to Ames  Iowa via yelp. Was NOT disappointed in the least. Showed up for dinner on my first night in from California and went at least 4 times over the course of the next 5 days I was there. SO good.The Brazilian burger is to die for. Absolutely scrumptious. Every drink I had was on point as well. Nick  the bar manager  put up with me putting him through the ringer with making me random drinks on the whim.I also liked that the place was almost a hidden gem as I could have passed right by it if I wasnt looking for it. Cute little hole in the wall but it just adds to the cool-ness.My server was Meriah and she was adorable and very attentive. Will always hit this place up when Im in town.
C K.,Des Moines, Iowa,3-22-2019,5,Outstanding food and service. Had the Beirut ans Brazilian burger  both were packed with flavor. Chocolate Confusion cake was amazing.
Tyler K,Frisco, CO ,5-13-2019,5,Everything about Cafe Beaudelaire is to die for. The highlight of anyone who is visiting Ames will be eating here. The environment can get a little crowded and loud  but the moment you taste the addicting food or amazing cocktails... the noise fades. The staff is friendly & accommodating  and I guarantee that once you eat here that you will be itching to come back.
Nicki S,Ankeny, IA ,5-11-2018,4,The environment is incredible. It takes you out of Ames  Iowa and places you smack dab in the middle of a small Brazilian pub. I got the a bacon burger because their burgers were recently voted the best in the state  and it was great. Not sure if its the best burger Ive ever had  but very tender and juicy with a wonderful flavor. Good fries  good portions  a unique option. A little pricey.
CJ B.,Plymouth, MN,6-18-2019,4,he yucca fries were absolutely amazing! Creamy yet crispy and the dipping sauce is delicious. We got a variety of burgers and all shared. They were all amazing  but I would likely get one of their specialty burgers if I go again.
David E.,Storm Lake , IA,2-29-2016,5,When I walked it  I wasnt sure that was the right place. There were only a few patrons  an the place looked more like a bar than a restaurant. Then I remembered that this is a college town  and most people were probably home preparing for classes Monday morning. I decided to stay and try their drink special of the day  a Bloody Mary with beer back. It was delicious  and had the right amount of spice.I asked the waitress what she suggested  and she said that the gyro is a favorite of most patrons. I decided to get the Brazilian burger instead. I got it spicy  and spicy it was. The flavors were fantastic. The combination of hot peppers with avocado and creamy cheese was perfect.
Tim M.,Jacksonville, FL,11-24-2018,5,One of the best burgers  I have had in a long time!!! The restaurant is a local classic college pub with a Brazilian themed menu. The staff is very friendly and help you with your food selection. The have a full bar and good beer selection. It is a must stop when you are in Ames.
Misty Blue R.,Savage, MN,8-19-2019,5,We came her twice over the weekend. The first night the 5 of us got a table right away. Service was slow but we were busy talking so it didnt bother us. We ordered right away but the dood just took awhile. Maybe 40 minutes. Waitress apologized and though we didnt say anything about wait time she gave us the employee discount of 30%. Burgers were fantastic and the fries were amazing. We went the next day to see if it was a fluke. Again seated right away and the food came out fast. And the good was just as good!!! Would recommend this place to all Ames newbies. (We got this spot the weekend before students arrived so I cant speak to the atmosphere when campus is full)
Brooke K.,Grimes, IA,10-24-2017,5,This place hit the spot. Came for takeout and got the Bauru sandwich with chicken. It was like a chicken pot pie in a sandwich...loved the wheat bread it was on too. Also got a side of the yucca fries which were sooo good. They were recommended and I was not let down. They are a little different than fries  hard to explain- give them a shot for yourself and you wont be disappointed. Cant wait to try more of the menu!
Yolande S.,San Francisco, CA,9-5-2017,5,Yay! This place is even better than it was 20 years ago. The vegetarian Bauru was dee-licious...perfect with the yucca fries. So happy I made time to check it out during my Ames visit - nice to see some things are still the same
Jessica G.,Ann Arbor, MI,3-18-2019,4,The food here is excellent and the drink menu has a good variety. The service is usually great. We had one visit with a terrible server who forgot to take our order and forgot to give us cutlery. The manager is extremely friendly and visibly goes around to check on the patrons.
M S.,Seattle, WA,8-18-2017,5,I have always loved  this place and its consistently awesome staff. The have great drink specials  and awesome food. I definitely recommend this place.
Sidd Y.,Grand Mound, IA,4-6-2019,4,We went here for lunch on a Saturday. Food was great not terribly expensive  fun cafe atmosphere too. Took longer than it shouldve to get our food... even though it was busy the place is small enough where it shouldnt have taken 30 minutes to get our meals. Overall I would come back if were ever in the area again.
Rex R.,Ames, IA,1-11-2019,5,Came to Ames in 1981 and have finally made to Cafe Beaudelaire. Started with Guiness which was perfect and a pao de queso which are yummy cheesy dough balls of delight. I had the Beirut with chicken which was very good. The Brasilian fries are very good and the yucca fries are excellent. I cannot wait to come back and try something else. Server was excellent as well!
Michael S. ,Miami, FL ,8-17-2019,1,Waited 15 minutes to even see a menu. Another 10 to even get water. Another 20 for one appetizer of fries. Another 40 for an entree  2 of which were just another appetizer (empeñadas). The other was a veggie gyro which was just a reheated pita bread topped with literal canned chickpeas and microwaved veggies. Not good in any way imaginable. Very bummed after hearing good things  but will be skipping this place on all future Ames trips.
Elaina O. ,Tulsa, OK,10-26-2019,1,We heard awesome things about this restaurant and tried to eat here after a football game. Unfortunately  we were wearing the wrong team colors and they refused to seat us even though we offered to separate our group into smaller tables. We would have loved to try Iowas best burger and continue having a great experience visiting Iowa but we were treated shockingly rudely.
Andrew J. ,Ames, IA,5-4-2016,1,"Alright… Do NOT go to this place for drinks if you return your drink if you dont like it, because they will not make you a new drink or even apologize for it, then proceed to charge you for it because ""you took a sip of it"". I ordered a pisco sour, but didnt like the drink. Went up to the bartender, and when I told him that I didnt like the drink, he did not apologize nor offered to make me another drink because the drink was ""according to the recipe of Cafe B"" Seriously..? Come on, you could be having a bad day, but it should not be a reason for you to provide an extra crappy service. The waitress also pressures you to leave the place (not outright, but passively enough to definitely notice), which Ive experienced in separate occasions other than this, when Ive visited Cafe B.. I used to love this place as I was a regular, but this terrible, terrible customer service really turned me off. 100%."
Katie B. ,Ames, IA ,10-15-2012,1,So I went with high expectations of this place. Honestly  it sucked big time. While the food was actually okay (the Bauru? sandwich was pretty good)  the service was terrible. And I actually mean terrible. We went when it wasnt even that busy  it was a Wednesday early afternoon  maybe only one other table was sat at the same time. And yet the service was terrible  the waitress was a total (sorry for my language but a total B****). She acted as if she was doing us a favor by serving us. I dont recall her name  but she seemed a bit on the older side  skinny  brown tied up hair in a pony tail. Its a shame because the food wasnt that bad  but because of their service  I would never go back nor recommend this place to any of my friends.
Scott R., Boulder, CO ,9-18-2017,2,Okay food. Small portions. Really REALLY slow service (30 minutes for the salad??). I dont write many reviews but this was unusually painful and the worst experience Ive had this year at least. Please be sure you have enough staff to wait and/or cook during dinner hour... our time is valuable.
Annaliese P.,Chicago, IL,12-5-2014,2,"Having attended Cafe Beaudelaire both as a restaurant-goer and a bar-attender, I feel I am qualified to give this a big ""meh"". The food is overpriced and flavorless. The yucca fries are indeed tasty, but the serving size is pitifully small. The service you receive here is mediocre at best, and usually abysmal. The bar area itself is very small, and allows only a very small occupancy. The drinks, while strong, are pretty overpriced compared to surrounding bars, and the atmosphere is only marginally preferable."
Kristine M. ,West Salem, WI,9-23-2018,3,"We went there for brunch this morning. My daughter ordered the veggie gyro and I ordered the gyro omelet... we also ordered two cups of of coffee… Be aware that there are no refills with the coffee- another $2 per cup and the second came with lipstick. We asked for the cup to be replaced; it appeared that they washed the cup and gave it back to us. When the food arrived, it was apparent that wrong omelet arrived- I received the Portuguese omelet. It was my second choice so I ate it anyway. When I told the waitress, she asked what she could do about it. I said it was fine and just wanted her to be aware Apparently, she pushed the wrong button… Both meals were very good..."
